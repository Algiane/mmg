FILES:
   experimental-run.sh: run a panel of tests in experimental mode (-h for help)
   nightly-run.sh     : run all tests during night (must be used with crontab or another task scheduler). ctest is run in verbose mode and the output is available in build/ctest$DATE.log.
   continuous-run.sh  : check automatically the repository at each commit and run nightlySVN-run.sh
   nighltySVN-run.sh  : check some build (compilation in Release or Minsizerel mod) and memory errors at each commit

   compare_listStruct.pl : script to compare files created by functions printTetra/printTria (mmg3d5)

USAGE:
  Only experimental-run and nightly-run are useful to developper.
  Results of tests are submitted on the local host vulcain so to see it you need to configure
  your ssh (.ssh/config) to have acces on vulcain. Then:
     you must forward the port 2000:
	$ssh -L 2000:localhost:80 vulcain
     and go to http://localhost:2000/CDash/user.php

   experimental-run.sh forward automatically the port 2000 during 2h.
