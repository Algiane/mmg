Example of use of library libmmg3d5:

  The mesh and solution are hard coded.

  First we remesh  with a detection of angles (between normals at 2 adjacent surfaces) smallest than 90 and a maximal size of 0.2.

  Then we remesh again with a maximal size of 0.1 and we save the mesh in result0.mesh/sol.
