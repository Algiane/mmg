We use crontab to run the nigthly test:
    $crontab -e #to configure the task (for now, we run nightly_run.sh every day at 23:55)

The script nightly_run.sh run CTest in option Nightly and print the output in ctest.log

CTestConfig.cmake contains the configuration for CTest (name of the project, hour of the nighly run...)

CTestCustom.cmake contains the cusomisation of the CTest options
