DIRECTORIES
  Doxygen  = Directory for automatic documentation
  build    = Directory for temporary files of cmake
  Scripts  = useful scripts (to run automatid tests and clean build)

FILES
  CMakeLists.txt = rule the makefile generation
  testing.cmake  = list of tests
  CTestConfig.cmake = configuration for CTest (name of the project, hour of the nighly run...)
  CTestCustom.cmake = cusomisation of the CTest options
  libSystem+libmesh5.supp = Valgrind suppression file for mac
  libmesh5.supp = Valgrind suppression file for debian

TO COMPILE :
  $cd build

#then, if you want to configure the build:
  $ccmake ..
#or:
  $cmake ..

  # if you've done $ccmake .. :
  # - you must configure (c) then if needed you can toogle to advanced mode (t)
  # - variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE can be set to Debug (for -g flag), Release (for -O3 flag)
  #   or Minsizrel (for -Os flag).
  # - to change the flag assciated to the build type you must be in advanced mode and
  #   set the wanted flag to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS or CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG or CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE...
  # Warning: the name of the executable output change with the build type.
  # Once changes are done, you must reconfigure (c) and generate the make file (g)

# Now, you can compile:
  $make

OUTPUT :
  mmg3d5 in normal mode
  mmg3d5_debug in Debug mode
  mmg3d5_O3 in Release mode
  mmg3d5_Os in MinSizeRel mode
